# Neural Network

Hello, and welcome to my neural network! This is where I store my second brain with notes from my mathematics and computer science degrees.

The site can be found [here](https://neuralnetwork.limaochang.dev/).

## Local Setup

HTTPS:

```
https://github.com/LimaoC/neural-network.git
cd neural-network
make  # run local web server
```

SSH:
```
git clone git@github.com:LimaoC/neural-network.git
cd neural-network
make  # run local web server
```

### Obsidian Vault

If you'd prefer to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) over the website version, you can open up the `content` directory as an Obsidian vault (with working links).
