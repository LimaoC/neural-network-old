Hello, and welcome to my neural network! This is where I store my second brain - filled with notes from my mathematics and computer science degrees.

Below is an exhaustive list of the tags in use. Each top-level (generally) represents a discipline of study and has a dedicated subdirectory in the domain (e.g. `/mathematics/`). Nested items are tags to further categorize the notes in that top-level item.

- [Mathematics](/mathematics)
	- [Formal Logic](/tags/formal-logic)
- [Statistics](/statistics)

> Tip: you can use `ctrl + k` to quick search the entire network of notes.
