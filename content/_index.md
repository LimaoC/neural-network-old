Hello, and welcome to my neural network! This is where I store my second brain - filled with notes from my mathematics and computer science degrees.

Below is the structure of the network. Each top-level (generally) represents a broad discipline/field and has tags to further subdivide the notes. The links below will take you to all the notes belonging to that particular discipline or tag.

/[computer-science](/computer-science) \
├─ [reasoning about programs](/tags/reasoning-about-programs) \
/[mathematics](/mathematics) \
├─ [formal logic](/tags/formal-logic) \
/[statistics](/statistics) \
├─ [probability](/tags/probability)

> Tip: you can use `ctrl + k` to quick search the entire network of notes.
