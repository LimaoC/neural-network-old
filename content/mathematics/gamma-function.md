## Definition
The *gamma function* is an extension of the factorial function to complex numbers, and is defined for all complex numbers except for non-positive integers.

For positive integers $n$,
$$\Gamma(n) = (n - 1)!,$$
and for complex numbers $z$ with a positive real part,
$$\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty x^{z-1} e^{-x} \thinspace dx.$$
