## Definition
[Events](statistics/event.md) $A_1, A_2, \dots$ are said to be *exhaustive* if $A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots = \Omega$, that is at least one $A_i$ must occur.

If $A_1, A_2, \dots$ are exhaustive and mutually exclusive (i.e. they cannot occur simultaneously), then they are a *partition* of $\Omega$ and are said to partition the sample space.
