## Definition
If $A$ and $B$ are two [events](statistics/event.md) such that they share no outcomes in common, they are said to be *disjoint*, that is $A \cap B = \varnothing$. More generally, $A_1, A_2, \dots$ is said to be *disjoint* if each pair of events $(A_i, A_j$) with $i \neq j$, is disjoint.
