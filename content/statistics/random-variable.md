## Definition
A random variable $X$ is a function or mapping from the possible outcomes in a [sample space](statistics/sample-space.md) to numerical values, usually the real numbers.

A random variable is said to be *discrete* if it takes values in (i.e. maps to) a countable set.

A random variable is said to be *continuous* if it takes values in (i.e. maps to) an *interval*.
