> (Also known as LOTUS). Let $X$ be a [discrete random variable](statistics/random-variable.md) with [probability mass function](statistics/probability-mass-function.md) $f_X(x)$ where $x \in S$, and let $g(X)$ be some function of $X$. Then the [expectation](statistics/expectation.md) of $g(X)$ is given by
> $$\mathbb{E}(g(X)) = \sum_{x \in S} g(x)f_X(x) = \sum_{x \in S} g(x) \mathbb{P}(X = x).$$
